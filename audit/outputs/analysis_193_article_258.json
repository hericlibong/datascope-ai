    "content": "Des intentions d'embauche en baisse, mais des difficultés de recrutement dans le bassin d'Alençon\n\nMoins d'un quart des entreprises prévoient de recruter en 2025 dans le bassin d'Alençon. Parmi les 2 355 embauches envisagées, une majorité s'annonce difficile à concrétiser.  \n\nLes entreprises d’Alençon (Orne) et de ses alentours prévoient 2 355 recrutements en 2025. Un chiffre en légère baisse, mais qui cache de fortes disparités selon les métiers et les secteurs. Résultat : les tensions sur le marché de l’emploi local restent vives.\n\nSelon l’enquête annuelle sur les besoins en main-d’œuvre, menée par France Travail Normandie et le Crédoc, 24,7 % des établissements du bassin envisagent de recruter cette année. C’est 1,6 point de moins qu’en 2024. Pourtant, le volume reste conséquent : près de 2 400 projets d’embauche, tous secteurs confondus.\n\n6 recrutements sur 10 jugés difficiles\n\nProblème : 61 % des employeurs déclarent rencontrer des difficultés pour recruter. Le bassin d’Alençon dépasse ici la moyenne régionale de 53 %.\n\nLes profils les plus concernés sont bien connus : agents d’entretien, aides à domicile, travailleurs sociaux, maçons qualifiés et personnels soignants.\n\nDes métiers essentiels, mais souvent pénibles, pas assez valorisés ni rémunérés ou en tension structurelle.\n\nDes besoins dans les services\n\nLes services aux particuliers concentrent 44 % des projets recensés. Viennent ensuite les services aux entreprises (18 %) et le commerce (10 %).\n\nLa construction se démarque avec 11 % des intentions d’embauche, bien au-dessus de la moyenne régionale.\n\nÀ l’inverse, l’industrie manufacturière est peu représentée : 4 % des projets dans le bassin, contre 9 % en Normandie.\n\nL’agriculture et l’agroalimentaire comptent pour 12 %, une part nettement plus élevée que la moyenne régionale.\n\n\nLes TPE en première ligne\n\nLa structure des entreprises locales influe aussi sur les projets de recrutement.\n\nLes très petites entreprises, de moins de 10 salariés, portent à elles seules 45 % des intentions recensées dans le bassin.\n\nLes établissements de taille moyenne, entre 10 et 199 salariés, en génèrent environ un tiers.\n\nLes grandes entreprises, de plus de 200 salariés, comptent pour 19 % des projets.\nQuels métiers ?\n\nEn volume de projets, les métiers les plus demandés sont ceux d’agents d’entretien de locaux, d’agriculteurs, de personnels de ménage chez les particuliers, d’aides de cuisine ou d’employés polyvalents, ainsi que les professionnels de l’animation socioculturelle.\n\nCes fonctions concentrent plusieurs centaines d’offres, souvent peu qualifiées mais essentielles à la vie économique locale.\n\n\nDes postes saisonniers\n\nEnfin, 21 % des projets recensés sont liés à des emplois saisonniers. Cela concerne principalement l’agriculture et la restauration, deux secteurs soumis à des pics d’activité.\nUn bassin sous tension\n\nLe bassin d’Alençon affiche donc une dynamique de recrutement un peu moins soutenue que l’an dernier, mais reste actif dans les services, la santé, le bâtiment et l’agriculture. Le nombre élevé de recrutements jugés difficiles souligne les défis à relever en matière d’attractivité des métiers, de conditions de travail et de formation adaptée.",

  "summary": "# Résultat d’analyse\n\n## Entités extraites\n- **Langue** : fr\n- **Organisations** : France Travail Normandie, Crédoc\n- **Lieux** : Alençon, Orne, Normandie\n- **Valeurs numériques** : un quart (0.25 None), 2 355 (2355.0 None), 24,7 % (24.7 %), 1,6 point (1.6 point), 2 400 (2400.0 None), 6 recrutements sur 10 (0.6 None), 61 % (61.0 %), 53 % (53.0 %), 44 % (44.0 %), 18 % (18.0 %), 10 % (10.0 %), 11 % (11.0 %), 4 % (4.0 %), 9 % (9.0 %), 12 % (12.0 %), 45 % (45.0 %), un tiers (0.33 None), 19 % (19.0 %), 21 % (21.0 %)\n\n## Suggestions d’angles\n\n### 1. Les services aux particuliers : moteur caché de l'emploi à Alençon\nAvec 44 % des projets de recrutement, les services aux particuliers dominent le marché de l'emploi local. Analyser comment ce secteur soutient l'économie locale malgré les difficultés de recrutement.\n\n### 2. TPE d'Alençon : pilier fragile du marché de l'emploi\nLes très petites entreprises représentent 45 % des intentions de recrutement dans le bassin. Explorer les défis spécifiques auxquels ces structures font face en matière de recrutement et de rétention des talents.\n\n### 3. Pourquoi les métiers en tension restent à pourvoir ?\nExaminer les raisons pour lesquelles certains métiers critiques, comme les agents d'entretien et les aides à domicile, peinent à attirer des candidats. Proposer des solutions basées sur des données sur les salaires et les conditions de travail.\n\n### 4. Emplois saisonniers : une aubaine ou une impasse ?\nAvec 21 % des projets liés à des emplois saisonniers, interroger l'impact de ces postes sur le marché de l'emploi local. Évaluer leur rôle dans l'agriculture et la restauration, et leur contribution à l'économie d'Alençon.\n\n### 5. Déséquilibres sectoriels : le paradoxe du marché de l'emploi à Alençon\nMettre en lumière les disparités entre secteurs, notamment la faible représentation de l'industrie manufacturière, et discuter des implications pour l'avenir économique du bassin d'Alençon.\n",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

          "description": "Canadian Wetlands Inventory (CWI) data for the Baie de l'Isle-Verte region. Created according to the method developed by the Canadian Wildlife Service, Quebec Region. \r\n\r\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the Canadian Wildlife Service, Quebec Region (CWS-QC) produced wetland maps for several sites in Quebec. This mapping was carried out as part of the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI), an initiative launched in 2002 in order to classify wetlands into the five major classes of the Canadian Wetlands Classification System, namely: bogs, fens, marshes, swamps and shallow open water. The selected approach combines Landsat-TM/ETM and RADARSAT-1 satellite imagery with object-oriented image classification.\r\n\r\nThe mapped sites are situated in a variety of ecozones and represent different types of landscapes and ecosystems. These sites include Lac Saint-Pierre, Lac Brome, Montérégie, Lac Saint-François (Appalachians), Grande-Plée-Bleue, Montmagny, Cap Tourmente, Baie de l’Isle-Verte, La Mauricie National Park, Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Radisson and Eastmain. These twelve sites represent 4% of Quebec’s land mass. The method was tested in British Columbia (Vancouver) and in the Northwest Territories (Kendall Island).\r\n\r\nA total of 8% of the territory constituted by the twelve sites is covered by wetlands, with the percentage for each site ranging from 2% to 15%. The classifications were validated using a method developed by CWS-QC which involves the visual interpretation of Landsat colour composites. Validation was performed in two ways: between wetlands and dry areas and between the five different types of wetlands. The overall accuracy for the first validation method ranges between 61% and 91%; for the second method, accuracy ranges between 47% and 98%.\r\n\r\nFor the methodology used to do the classifications, please refer to the following reference :\r\n\r\nGrenier, M., Demers, A.-M., Labrecque, S., Benoit, M., Fournier R., and Drolet B. 2007.

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

The Factors are based on GHG data for 2022. Factors are given for all NAICS-defined commodities at the 6-digit level except for electricity, government, and households. Each record consists of three factor types as in the previous releases: Supply Chain Emissions without Margins (SEF), Margins of Supply Chain Emissions (MEF), and Supply Chain Emissions with Margins (SEF+MEF). One set of Factors provides kg carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) per 2022 U.S. dollar (USD) for all GHGs combined using 100-yr global warming potentials from IPCC 5th report (AR5) to calculate the equivalents. In this dataset there is one SEF, MEF and SEF+MEF per commodity. The other dataset of Factors provides kg of each unique GHG emitted per 2022 dollar per commodity without the CO2e calculation. The dollar in the denominator of all factors uses purchaser prices. See the supporting file 'Aboutv1.3SupplyChainGHGEmissionFactors.docx' for complete documentation of this dataset. ",

      "description": "Canadian Wetlands Inventory (CWI) data for the Baie de l'Isle-Verte region. Created according to the method developed by the Canadian Wildlife Service, Quebec Region. \r\n\r\nBetween 2003 and 2007, the Canadian Wildlife Service, Quebec Region (CWS-QC) produced wetland maps for several sites in Quebec. This mapping was carried out as part of the Canadian Wetland Inventory (CWI), an initiative launched in 2002 in order to classify wetlands into the five major classes of the Canadian Wetlands Classification System, namely: bogs, fens, marshes, swamps and shallow open water. The selected approach combines Landsat-TM/ETM and RADARSAT-1 satellite imagery with object-oriented image classification.\r\n\r\nThe mapped sites are situated in a variety of ecozones and represent different types of landscapes and ecosystems. These sites include Lac Saint-Pierre, Lac Brome, Montérégie, Lac Saint-François (Appalachians), Grande-Plée-Bleue, Montmagny, Cap Tourmente, Baie de l’Isle-Verte, La Mauricie National Park, Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Radisson and Eastmain. These twelve sites represent 4% of Quebec’s land mass. The method was tested in British Columbia (Vancouver) and in the Northwest Territories (Kendall Island).\r\n\r\nA total of 8% of the territory constituted by the twelve sites is covered by wetlands, with the percentage for each site ranging from 2% to 15%. The classifications were validated using a method developed by CWS-QC which involves the visual interpretation of Landsat colour composites. Validation was performed in two ways: between wetlands and dry areas and between the five different types of wetlands. The overall accuracy for the first validation method ranges between 61% and 91%; for the second method, accuracy ranges between 47% and 98%.\r\n\r\nFor the methodology used to do the classifications, please refer to the following reference :\r\n\r\nGrenier, M., Demers, A.-M., Labrecque, S., Benoit, M., Fournier R., and Drolet B. 2007.
