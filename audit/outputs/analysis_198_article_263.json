    "content": "Dramatic rise in whale and dolphin strandings in Scotland\n\nResearch shows steep increases over past 30 years, after summer of strandings across Europe\n\n\nThe number of marine mammals stranded in Scotland has risen dramatically in the past 30 years, a study has found.\n\nFrom 1992 to 2022, 5,147 cetaceans died on Scottish shores, and a new paper shows steep increases in the rate of strandings of up to 800% in some species, continuing exponentially every year.\n\nThe paper, by the University of Glasgow’s Scottish marine animal stranding scheme (Smass), follows this summer’s extraordinary sequence of rarely seen, deep-diving whale species stranding on northern European shores. Over a period of just over two weeks, 36 beaked whales and pilot whales were found in locations from western and southern Ireland to Orkney, Norfolk, the Netherlands and southern Sweden. The animals appeared to have entered shallow seas where they could not forage for their usual foods such as deep-sea squid.\n\nThe widespread locations of these events is provoking serious concern, especially among volunteer groups who work to save the stranded whales – without success, in all of the above cases.\n\n“Clusters of beaked whales should raise suspicions,” said Dr Andrew Brownlow, the director of Smass.\n\nIt is believed that sonic disturbance can cause deep-diving whales to strand. Rachel Lennon, the lead author of the paper published in the journal Scientific Reports, said that in Scotland “sources of anthropogenic noise are abundant, including seismic survey air guns and drilling from industrial construction”.\n\nThe new paper does not cite concerns that military sonar exercises in the open ocean are a known factor in such events. Brownlow noted that a “globally unprecendented number” of 118 stranded beaked whales off Ireland and western Scotland in 2018 was traced to a single sound source off the continental shelf.\n\nThe paper appears only weeks after Smass scientists attended the strandings of four northern bottlenose whales – another beaked whale species – and a pod of 23 pilot whales on the Orkney islands. The pilot whale stranding came almost exactly a year after a record 77 of the same species stranded on the same Orkney beach. A total of 150 animals have mass stranded off Scotland this year.\n\nSmass scientists are also concerned that the number of stranded baleen whales such as fin, minke and humpback whales has risen sharply over the survey period. This may be due to more animals moving north as waters warm due to climate breakdown. It may also be a delayed result of the cessation of whale hunting – Lennon noted that “as populations begin to recover from the impacts of historic whaling, reports of entanglement have increased”.\n\nAs surface feeders, baleen whales are prone to being caught in fishing gear, leading to protracted deaths from starvation or infection. The paper also shows an increase in the number of stranded common dolphins and harbour porpoises, which can be vulnerable to collisions with leisure craft.\n\nThe 30-year report shows that stranded whales and dolphins act as “sentinels” – visible warning signs of how human activity is affecting the marine environment.\n\n“Clearly the oceans are changing,” Brownlow said, “and Scotland is on the edge of this flux. We now get sperm whales calving off our shores whereas we never saw females in these northern waters before. Beaked whales only used to be recorded in small numbers in the autumn. Temperature, salinity, distribution of prey, oceanic heatwaves – the pattern is moving, and we need to be better at working out where these animals are, and when.\n\n“This is the new normal, and we must tread as softly as we can.”",

The six maps in the top left portion of this plate illustrate the number of pelts taken in the 1950/1951 furring season by province and territory for the following animals: wild beaver, wild and ranch raised mink, wild ermine, wild muskrat, wild and ranch raised fox, and wild squirrel. An additional summary map shows the pelts taken for all fur bearing animals in the 1950/1951 furring season. The map in the bottom left portion of this plate shows the distribution of fur farms, and the distribution of fur trading establishments. As trapping was carried on in nearly all parts of Canada, establishments licensed to buy furs were found throughout the country. However, only those outside the main, generally settled areas were shown individually on this map. Several maps on the upper right portion of this plate deal with sealing, whaling and fish processing. The first of these maps shows the migration route of harp seals and separately indicates the number of pups and adult harp seals caught annually by Canadians as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. The next map shows the species distribution of whales on the West Coast and the location of a whaling station. Another map shows fin whale migration routes and the location of a fin whale whaling station as well as two pilot whale whaling stations on the East Coast. This map also indicates where pilot whales were abundant or frequently found. It should be noted that the locations of whaling stations shown on these maps is as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. Two other maps show the distribution of fish processing plants for the East and West Coasts. The final map, on the bottom right portion of this plate shows the distribution of the 1951 labour force engaged in fishing and trapping.",

Fish, mainly brook trout, are harvested using electrofishing equipment in a closed 100-square-metre stretch of stream. Three fishing sessions, or passages, are carried out. The fish caught are measured and weighed. Certain data on habitat and physicochemical properties of water are also recorded. This monitoring takes place in late July and early August, when stream water levels are generally low. The fishing site is located near the benthic invertebrate community and water temperature monitoring site for each of the eleven watercourses studied. ",

          "description": "Species Distribution Models (SDM) were used to predict and identify priority areas for enhanced monitoring of cetaceans in eastern Canadian waters off Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. This data set represents information presented in Gomez et al. (2020) and includes sighting records and SDM outputs for ten cetacean species with sufficient records (n > 450) and sightings only for an additional six species. For more information about sighting records including which were included in each SDM, please see Gomez et al. 2020.   \n  \n  This study used a compilation of aerial- and vessel-based cetacean sightings data from 1975-2015 assembled in Gomez et al. (2017) from variety of sources. Note that sightings data from many of these sources are not effort-corrected and apparent distribution patterns based on these opportunistic sightings data are biased by when and where survey activities were conducted. Unfavorable weather and reduced visual effort in winter, spring, and autumn likely account for the fewer sighting records in these seasons compared to summer. The dataset does not include dead animal, stranding, entanglement or entrapment data. While some of the databases include records obtained during the whaling period (catches or sightings recorded prior to 1975), for all analyses/modelling conducted in this study, only sightings of free-swimming whales obtained during the post-whaling period (1975-2015) were used. Quality control checks included discarding all records outside of our study area and removing redundant records (identical species, day, month, latitude and longitude).The data used do not reflect any updates or corrections to the databases that have occurred since the data were compiled in 2016. Sightings are not available for download here, please contact the original data sources listed below to obtain raw sightings data.    \n  \n  This study represents an important initiative in eastern Canada to highlight key areas for cetacean monitoring in waters off Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. Habitats with high suitability  are interpreted as areas where cetacean monitoring efforts may be prioritized, and results can help direct future survey efforts. These model outputs used cetacean sightings from several decades and dynamic environmental predictors that used seasonal averages across multiple years. As proxies for prey availability, five predictor environmental variables were selected for the SDM: ocean depth, compound topographic index, sea surface temperature, areas of persistently high chlorophyll-a concentration, and regional chlorophyll-a magnitude. See Gomez et al. (2020) for further details on modelling methods. Persistent patterns over time (between 1975-2015) are the main patterns expected to be captured by these models. Further, SDM results presented here are not the same as species density maps; rather, they portray predicted suitable habitat based on environmental characteristics and sightings data that were not always derived from effort-based surveys. Consequently, the use of these models in marine spatial planning processes should be accompanied by complimentary approaches such as acoustic and visual validation of the SDM results as well as additional monitoring and modeling efforts. Please refer to Gomez et al. (2020) for examples on how to best use these data outputs. Future efforts will focus on using more recent data and improving these models to facilitate the inclusion of cetaceans in marine spatial planning processes that are currently underway.    \n  \n  Data sources:   \n  \n  Fisheries and Oceans Canada Maritimes region and Newfoundland and Labrador region  (Whale Sightings Database, Ocean and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Dartmouth, NS; http://www.inter.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Maritimes/SABS/popec/sara/Database, MacDonald et. al. 2017)   \n  \n  Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS; http://www.iobis.org/),   \n  \n  North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (NARWC; http://www.narwc.org/)   \n  \n  Whitehead Lab at Dalhousie University (http://whitelab.biology.dal.ca/)   \n  \n  Environment and Climate Change Canada’s (Canadian Wildlife Service) Eastern Canada Seabirds at Sea (ECSAS) program (Gjerdrum et al. 2012).    \n  \n  References:   \n  \n  Gomez, C., Konrad, C.M., Vanderlaan, A., Moors-Murphy, H.B., Marotte, E., Lawson, J.,  \n  \n  Kouwenberg, A-L., Fuentes-Yaco, C., Buren, A. 2020.

          "description": "The data in this dataset represent an amalgamation of sea turtle sighting, stranding, and entrapment events, mainly near Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada.  \n  \n  This document summarises the detection events data for Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and Green (Chelonia mydas) Turtles that has been collected from opportunistic and systematic survey sources, plus stranding and entrapment records, in the waters of NL from 1946 to 2023. To a much lesser extent there are also detection records for the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. Scotian Shelf, and northeastern U.S. waters.  \n  \n  These detection records are mostly derived from opportunistic reports, so there are rarely data for a report that includes measures of the observer effort expended to make the detection, and rarely associated imagery. During DFO aerial surveys there are measures of effort in most cases, enabling the turtle sightings reports to be used in habitat modelling (e.g., Mosnier et al. 2018).  \n  \n  Most of the information variables (such as “Date”, “Latitude”, “Longitude”, “Number of Animals”) have been obtained from the detection report. In some cases data for variables such as “Location Reliability”, “ID Reliability”, “Platform”, and “Strand or Entrapment Outcome” were derived from interpretation of the comments associated with the report, if available. For description of the variables in the dataset see the Data Dictionary.  \n  \n  References:  \n  \n  Mosnier, A., Gosselin, J.-F., Lawson, J., Plourde, S., and Lesage, V. 2018.

          "description": "This dataset is a collection of shapefiles that set out the boundaries of final agreed Management Units (MUs) for the seven most common cetacean species in UK waters. The boundaries are supported by a paper published on JNCC's website:\n\nhttp://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-6943\n\nThe Inter-Agency Marine Mammal Working Group (IAMMWG), comprising representatives of Natural England (NE), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) met at SNH Edinburgh on 28th June 2012. Expert scientific advice was also sought from SMRU.\n\nThe paper derives from discussions at that meeting and subsequent correspondence. Details of each MU are provided, including boundaries and estimated abundance figures. The MUs provide an indication of the spatial scales at which impacts of plans and projects alone, cumulatively and in-combination, need to be assessed for the key cetacean species in UK waters, with consistency across the UK.\n\nThe MUs have been fully incorporated into the Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) interim model for assessing the impacts of marine renewable energy developments on marine mammals, developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) on behalf of The Crown Estate, the Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC), Marine Scotland and the SNCBs. The interim PCoD model was published in February 2014: see http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2014/02/8509.\n\nThe MU boundaries detailed in the paper are final and will not change until they are formally reviewed, anticipated to occur in 2019, and every five years thereafter.",

The six maps in the top left portion of this plate illustrate the number of pelts taken in the 1950/1951 furring season by province and territory for the following animals: wild beaver, wild and ranch raised mink, wild ermine, wild muskrat, wild and ranch raised fox, and wild squirrel. An additional summary map shows the pelts taken for all fur bearing animals in the 1950/1951 furring season. The map in the bottom left portion of this plate shows the distribution of fur farms, and the distribution of fur trading establishments. As trapping was carried on in nearly all parts of Canada, establishments licensed to buy furs were found throughout the country. However, only those outside the main, generally settled areas were shown individually on this map. Several maps on the upper right portion of this plate deal with sealing, whaling and fish processing. The first of these maps shows the migration route of harp seals and separately indicates the number of pups and adult harp seals caught annually by Canadians as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. The next map shows the species distribution of whales on the West Coast and the location of a whaling station. Another map shows fin whale migration routes and the location of a fin whale whaling station as well as two pilot whale whaling stations on the East Coast. This map also indicates where pilot whales were abundant or frequently found. It should be noted that the locations of whaling stations shown on these maps is as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. Two other maps show the distribution of fish processing plants for the East and West Coasts. The final map, on the bottom right portion of this plate shows the distribution of the 1951 labour force engaged in fishing and trapping.",

The project responded to a call to “explain the major changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentration over glacial-interglacial timescales”. The project had three strands. In the first strand, tools to improve understanding and modelling of methane were worked on; this included improvements to models, as well as new constraining datasets. In the second strand, similar improvements for CO2 were to be made. The third strand included model simulations and a major data compilation covering the 800,000 year ice core period.\n\nMuch of the early research in this project used the simple Earth system model GENIE, which generally yields robust results. For example, CO2-forced transient simulations over 650,000 years reproduced Antarctic temperature anomalies with a high correlation, broadly capturing the QUEST Final Report, June 2011 22 magnitude of glacial-interglacial temperature changes. This study found that warm peaks in interglacials are consistent with changes in the meridional overturning circulation.",

Users should only access this superseded version for special cases, such as reproducing studies. If necessary, this version can be accessed by contacting NCEI.*The Integrated Surface Dataset (ISD) is composed of worldwide surface weather observations from over 35,000 stations, though the best spatial coverage is evident in North America, Europe, Australia, and parts of Asia. Parameters included are: air quality, atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature/dew point, atmospheric winds, clouds, precipitation, ocean waves, tides and more. ISD refers to the data contained within the digital database as well as the format in which the hourly, synoptic (3-hourly), and daily weather observations are stored. The format conforms to Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS). ISD provides hourly data that can be used in a wide range of climatological applications. For some stations, data may go as far back as 1901, though most data show a substantial increase in volume in the 1940s and again in the early 1970s. Currently, there are over 14,000 \"active\" stations updated daily in the database.\n\nFor user convenience, a subset of just the hourly data is available to users for download. It is referred to as Integrated Surface Global Hourly data, see associated download links for access to this subset.",

The six maps in the top left portion of this plate illustrate the number of pelts taken in the 1950/1951 furring season by province and territory for the following animals: wild beaver, wild and ranch raised mink, wild ermine, wild muskrat, wild and ranch raised fox, and wild squirrel. An additional summary map shows the pelts taken for all fur bearing animals in the 1950/1951 furring season. The map in the bottom left portion of this plate shows the distribution of fur farms, and the distribution of fur trading establishments. As trapping was carried on in nearly all parts of Canada, establishments licensed to buy furs were found throughout the country. However, only those outside the main, generally settled areas were shown individually on this map. Several maps on the upper right portion of this plate deal with sealing, whaling and fish processing. The first of these maps shows the migration route of harp seals and separately indicates the number of pups and adult harp seals caught annually by Canadians as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. The next map shows the species distribution of whales on the West Coast and the location of a whaling station. Another map shows fin whale migration routes and the location of a fin whale whaling station as well as two pilot whale whaling stations on the East Coast. This map also indicates where pilot whales were abundant or frequently found. It should be noted that the locations of whaling stations shown on these maps is as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. Two other maps show the distribution of fish processing plants for the East and West Coasts. The final map, on the bottom right portion of this plate shows the distribution of the 1951 labour force engaged in fishing and trapping.",

The abundance, size structure and condition of the fish in a brook trout population are sensitive to changes in the environment, specifically those caused by the presence of an invasive alien species, pollution or climate change, making this measure a good indicator of the health of the aquatic ecosystem. Fish, mainly brook trout, are harvested using electrofishing equipment in a closed 100-square-metre stretch of stream. Three fishing sessions, or passages, are carried out. The fish caught are measured and weighed. Certain data on habitat and physicochemical properties of water are also recorded. This monitoring takes place in late July and early August, when stream water levels are generally low. The fishing site is located near the benthic invertebrate community and water temperature monitoring site for each of the eleven watercourses studied. ",

      "title": "Identifying priority areas to enhance monitoring of cetaceans in the Northwest Atlantic Ocean",
      "description": "Species Distribution Models (SDM) were used to predict and identify priority areas for enhanced monitoring of cetaceans in eastern Canadian waters off Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. This data set represents information presented in Gomez et al. (2020) and includes sighting records and SDM outputs for ten cetacean species with sufficient records (n > 450) and sightings only for an additional six species. For more information about sighting records including which were included in each SDM, please see Gomez et al. 2020.   \n  \n  This study used a compilation of aerial- and vessel-based cetacean sightings data from 1975-2015 assembled in Gomez et al. (2017) from variety of sources. Note that sightings data from many of these sources are not effort-corrected and apparent distribution patterns based on these opportunistic sightings data are biased by when and where survey activities were conducted. Unfavorable weather and reduced visual effort in winter, spring, and autumn likely account for the fewer sighting records in these seasons compared to summer. The dataset does not include dead animal, stranding, entanglement or entrapment data. While some of the databases include records obtained during the whaling period (catches or sightings recorded prior to 1975), for all analyses/modelling conducted in this study, only sightings of free-swimming whales obtained during the post-whaling period (1975-2015) were used. Quality control checks included discarding all records outside of our study area and removing redundant records (identical species, day, month, latitude and longitude).The data used do not reflect any updates or corrections to the databases that have occurred since the data were compiled in 2016. Sightings are not available for download here, please contact the original data sources listed below to obtain raw sightings data.    \n  \n  This study represents an important initiative in eastern Canada to highlight key areas for cetacean monitoring in waters off Nova Scotia, Newfoundland and Labrador. Habitats with high suitability  are interpreted as areas where cetacean monitoring efforts may be prioritized, and results can help direct future survey efforts. These model outputs used cetacean sightings from several decades and dynamic environmental predictors that used seasonal averages across multiple years. As proxies for prey availability, five predictor environmental variables were selected for the SDM: ocean depth, compound topographic index, sea surface temperature, areas of persistently high chlorophyll-a concentration, and regional chlorophyll-a magnitude. See Gomez et al. (2020) for further details on modelling methods. Persistent patterns over time (between 1975-2015) are the main patterns expected to be captured by these models. Further, SDM results presented here are not the same as species density maps; rather, they portray predicted suitable habitat based on environmental characteristics and sightings data that were not always derived from effort-based surveys. Consequently, the use of these models in marine spatial planning processes should be accompanied by complimentary approaches such as acoustic and visual validation of the SDM results as well as additional monitoring and modeling efforts. Please refer to Gomez et al. (2020) for examples on how to best use these data outputs. Future efforts will focus on using more recent data and improving these models to facilitate the inclusion of cetaceans in marine spatial planning processes that are currently underway.    \n  \n  Data sources:   \n  \n  Fisheries and Oceans Canada Maritimes region and Newfoundland and Labrador region  (Whale Sightings Database, Ocean and Ecosystem Sciences Division, Dartmouth, NS; http://www.inter.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/Maritimes/SABS/popec/sara/Database, MacDonald et. al. 2017)   \n  \n  Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS; http://www.iobis.org/),   \n  \n  North Atlantic Right Whale Consortium (NARWC; http://www.narwc.org/)   \n  \n  Whitehead Lab at Dalhousie University (http://whitelab.biology.dal.ca/)   \n  \n  Environment and Climate Change Canada’s (Canadian Wildlife Service) Eastern Canada Seabirds at Sea (ECSAS) program (Gjerdrum et al. 2012).    \n  \n  References:   \n  \n  Gomez, C., Konrad, C.M., Vanderlaan, A., Moors-Murphy, H.B., Marotte, E., Lawson, J.,  \n  \n  Kouwenberg, A-L., Fuentes-Yaco, C., Buren, A. 2020.

      "description": "The data in this dataset represent an amalgamation of sea turtle sighting, stranding, and entrapment events, mainly near Newfoundland and Labrador (NL), Canada.  \n  \n  This document summarises the detection events data for Leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), Loggerhead (Caretta caretta), and Green (Chelonia mydas) Turtles that has been collected from opportunistic and systematic survey sources, plus stranding and entrapment records, in the waters of NL from 1946 to 2023. To a much lesser extent there are also detection records for the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence. Scotian Shelf, and northeastern U.S. waters.  \n  \n  These detection records are mostly derived from opportunistic reports, so there are rarely data for a report that includes measures of the observer effort expended to make the detection, and rarely associated imagery. During DFO aerial surveys there are measures of effort in most cases, enabling the turtle sightings reports to be used in habitat modelling (e.g., Mosnier et al. 2018).  \n  \n  Most of the information variables (such as “Date”, “Latitude”, “Longitude”, “Number of Animals”) have been obtained from the detection report. In some cases data for variables such as “Location Reliability”, “ID Reliability”, “Platform”, and “Strand or Entrapment Outcome” were derived from interpretation of the comments associated with the report, if available.

      "description": "This dataset is a collection of shapefiles that set out the boundaries of final agreed Management Units (MUs) for the seven most common cetacean species in UK waters. The boundaries are supported by a paper published on JNCC's website:\n\nhttp://jncc.defra.gov.uk/page-6943\n\nThe Inter-Agency Marine Mammal Working Group (IAMMWG), comprising representatives of Natural England (NE), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH), Natural Resources Wales (NRW) and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) met at SNH Edinburgh on 28th June 2012. Expert scientific advice was also sought from SMRU.\n\nThe paper derives from discussions at that meeting and subsequent correspondence. Details of each MU are provided, including boundaries and estimated abundance figures. The MUs provide an indication of the spatial scales at which impacts of plans and projects alone, cumulatively and in-combination, need to be assessed for the key cetacean species in UK waters, with consistency across the UK.\n\nThe MUs have been fully incorporated into the Population Consequences of Disturbance (PCoD) interim model for assessing the impacts of marine renewable energy developments on marine mammals, developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) on behalf of The Crown Estate, the Department of Energy & Climate Change (DECC), Marine Scotland and the SNCBs. The interim PCoD model was published in February 2014: see http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2014/02/8509.\n\nThe MU boundaries detailed in the paper are final and will not change until they are formally reviewed, anticipated to occur in 2019, and every five years thereafter.",

An additional summary map shows the pelts taken for all fur bearing animals in the 1950/1951 furring season. The map in the bottom left portion of this plate shows the distribution of fur farms, and the distribution of fur trading establishments. As trapping was carried on in nearly all parts of Canada, establishments licensed to buy furs were found throughout the country. However, only those outside the main, generally settled areas were shown individually on this map. Several maps on the upper right portion of this plate deal with sealing, whaling and fish processing. The first of these maps shows the migration route of harp seals and separately indicates the number of pups and adult harp seals caught annually by Canadians as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. The next map shows the species distribution of whales on the West Coast and the location of a whaling station. Another map shows fin whale migration routes and the location of a fin whale whaling station as well as two pilot whale whaling stations on the East Coast. This map also indicates where pilot whales were abundant or frequently found. It should be noted that the locations of whaling stations shown on these maps is as of the 1958 publication date of this atlas plate. Two other maps show the distribution of fish processing plants for the East and West Coasts. The final map, on the bottom right portion of this plate shows the distribution of the 1951 labour force engaged in fishing and trapping.",

      "description": "DESIRE (Dynamics of the Earth System and the Ice-Core Record) was part of Theme 2 QUEST (Quantifying and Understanding the Earth System) programme. \n\nThis dataset collection contains chemical traces, sea conditions and meteorological measurements from the Tropospheric Offline Model of Chemistry and Transport (TOMCAT) model and MITgcm (MIT General Circulation Model). \n\nThe project involved an Anglo-French collaboration between QUEST and INSU (Institut national des sciences de l'univers). The project responded to a call to “explain the major changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and methane concentration over glacial-interglacial timescales”. The project had three strands. In the first strand, tools to improve understanding and modelling of methane were worked on; this included improvements to models, as well as new constraining datasets. In the second strand, similar improvements for CO2 were to be made. The third strand included model simulations and a major data compilation covering the 800,000 year ice core period.\n\nMuch of the early research in this project used the simple Earth system model GENIE, which generally yields robust results. For example, CO2-forced transient simulations over 650,000 years reproduced Antarctic temperature anomalies with a high correlation, broadly capturing the QUEST Final Report, June 2011 22 magnitude of glacial-interglacial temperature changes. This study found that warm peaks in interglacials are consistent with changes in the meridional overturning circulation.",
