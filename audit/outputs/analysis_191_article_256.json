    "content": "Moustiques tigres : \"Toute la France hexagonale va être touchée, et les villes en premier\", prévient un spécialiste\n\nL'insecte a colonisé 81 des 96 départements métropolitains et les maladies qu'il véhicule ne sont désormais plus \"exotiques\". \n\n\nToute la France hexagonale va être touchée, et les villes en premier\", alerte Didier Fontenille, entomologiste, directeur de recherche émérite à l’Institut de recherche pour le développement (IRD), alors que les cas autochtones de contaminations à la dengue(Nouvelle fenêtre) et au chikungunya(Nouvelle fenêtre) battent des records.\n:\nà lire aussi CARTES. Insecte des villes, arrivé par le Sud, qui se déplace grâce aux voitures… Visualisez comment le moustique tigre colonise la France hexagonale\n\nCes maladies \"qu'on considérait comme exotiques par le passé\" touchent maintenant la France hexagonale \"en raison de la présence du moustique tigre et de son abondance dans de plus en plus de départements\". Au total, 81 des 96 départements métropolitains sont considérés comme colonisés. Ceux qui y échappent encore, sont principalement situés en Bretagne, Normandie, dans le nord et dans l'est de la France. Mais \"j'ai le regret d'annoncer aux personnes qui vivent dans ces départements qu'elles seront également touchées\", alerte l'entomologiste. Les villes vont être touchées en premier car elles concentrent des \"îlots de chaleur, qui font que le moustique s'y trouve bien et trouve à manger puisqu'il pique les humains\".\nGénétiquement adapté, hiberne \"comme une marmotte\"\n\nSi la France concentre 65 espèces différentes de moustiques, c'est le moustique tigre qui est en cause. Arrivé en 2004 en France métropolitaine, \"il est originaire d'Asie du Sud-Est, donc c'est un moustique tropical et il est très adapté aux climats chauds, mais génétiquement, il s'est adapté aux climats tempérés\", explique Didier Fontenille. \"Il est capable de passer l'hiver sous forme d'œuf, en hibernation, comme une marmotte\".\n\nMais il se réveille en fonction de la \"durée du jour\" et non de la chaleur. \"En revanche, ce qui se passe avec le changement climatique, c'est que les conditions durant lesquelles il est actif sont plus favorables, donc on va avoir plus de moustiques parce qu'il y aura plus d'œufs qui seront pondus par les femelles\". Ainsi, on ne trouvera pas forcément des moustiques plus tôt ou tard dans la saison, mais après leur réveil, leur nombre sera tout de suite plus important.\nSeule méthode de lutte efficace : la stérilisation des mâles\n\nUne politique très efficace, \"encore au stade de recherche expérimentale\" est celle de la stérilisation des moustiques mâles. \"C'est difficile à mettre en œuvre\" et \"très coûteux\" mais \"ça marche très bien\" puisque les œufs pondus par les femelles ne vont pas éclore et les populations vont \"diminuer petit à petit\". C'est cependant une disparition lente qui n'est donc \"pas du tout utilisable en période épidémique\". Il espère cependant que la technique \"va se développer\", notamment, car elle permet de \"s'affranchir des insecticides\".",

Moustique tigre : cartographie de sa progression en France\nVisualiser l'évolution géographique de la colonisation des moustiques tigres depuis leur arrivée en 2004. Comparer les régions touchées avec celles qui sont encore épargnées pour comprendre les facteurs géographiques et climatiques en jeu.\n\n### 2. Impact économique des moustiques tigres sur le tourisme\nAnalyser comment la présence croissante du moustique tigre dans les zones touristiques influence l'économie locale. Étudier les coûts associés à la prévention et aux soins de santé dans les départements les plus touchés.\n\n### 3. Changement climatique et adaptation du moustique tigre\nExaminer la corrélation entre le réchauffement climatique et l'adaptation génétique du moustique tigre en France. Investiguer comment ces changements influencent la durée et la période d'activité du moustique.\n\n### 4. Efficacité des méthodes de lutte contre le moustique tigre\nComparer les différentes méthodes de lutte contre le moustique tigre en termes d'efficacité et de coût. Évaluer les perspectives de développement de la stérilisation des mâles comme alternative aux insecticides.\n\n### 5. Les villes face à l'invasion silencieuse du moustique tigre\nÉtudier pourquoi les villes sont plus vulnérables en raison des îlots de chaleur et de la densité de population. Discuter des mesures urbaines possibles pour limiter la prolifération de cet insecte.\n",

      "description": "This product includes rose diagrams and tables of wind patterns at volcanoes listed in the Smithsonian Institution’s Volcanoes of the World Database.  At each volcano, the speed and direction of wind above the volcano were read from output of the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis 1 model, at twice-daily intervals from January 1, 1990 to December 28, 2009.  These results were then plotted as 20 wind rose diagrams, divided into four seasons and five elevation intervals, and as one summary plot for year-round winds at 0-5 km elevation above sea level.  Rose petals indicate the downwind direction of the wind vector.  These rose diagrams are wrapped into a single zip file for each volcano.  Also included in the zip file are five text files, for elevation intervals (above sea level) of 0-5, 5-11, 11-16, 16-24, and 24-40km, which give wind vectors, twice daily (at 0000 and 1200 UTC) over the 1990-2010 time range.  The rose diagrams are accessible through the attached kmz file, which opens in Google Earth, or as hypertext links in the attached html table.  In the kmz file, placemarks at each volcano can be opened to reveal the summary wind rose diagram, along with a link to the page containing the other data.",
