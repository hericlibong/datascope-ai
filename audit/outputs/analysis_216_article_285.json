    "content": "opinion\nA curfew won't save Indianapolis teens. Investment in them will. | Opinion\n\nTeens are seeking stimulation because they're bored, connection because they're lonely and support we've taken away from them.\n\nIt was half past midnight. We were returning from a wedding, stunned at the sight of hundreds of teens lining the sidewalks downtown. I recognized one as my student, Dakari. The next morning, I saw the headline: gunfire, 2 a.m., three teens wounded. They never identify juveniles by name. For teachers, it’s torturous — were they one of ours?\n\nI stopped Dakari in the hall Monday. “I clocked you out late Saturday night. Everything good?” Dakari is a natural leader, unafraid of truth, which earned him the respect of his classmates. And luckily, he trusted me. Yeah, he was less than a block away. He was shaken, but unhurt. “I hope that’s the last time you’re out that late,\" I said.\n\n“Nah, we’re going out again next weekend.”\n\nMy heart sank at his response. It sank again when Indianapolis approved its new curfew this month — including a proposal to charge parents fines. It seems easy, right? But easy solutions are rarely good ones.\n\nBriggs: Mike Braun grandstands on Indianapolis crime while murders drop 24%\n\nIndianapolis has become a city that is afraid of its own children. I see teens demonized across social media as “feral” and “violent.” But these same teens are the most creative, savvy and thoughtful students I know. They are full of ideas about how to improve their community, and they jump at the chance to help. Unfortunately, we offer few ways to use these aptitudes.\n\nWe're offering teens too little help\n\nStudents in out-of-school programs have lower absenteeism and delinquency and better scores and earnings. In Baltimore, targeted youth programs almost single-handedly cut violence by a third. But in Indiana, we don’t have enough programs for them. For every child in one, three more are waitlisted, with demand outpacing supply.\n\nMeanwhile, the percentage of children alone and unsupervised has actually decreased. However, being home doesn’t mean children are safe. More youth are depressed, isolated or contemplating suicide than ever before, especially teen girls. And more teens are armed with guns and dying from them, including in rural counties. Safe storage proposals routinely fail, so Indiana has one of the highest rates of accidental child shootings in the country.\n\nSo why are so many teens out after dark? Like most of his peers, Dakari wasn’t out there to hurt anyone — he was there because his friends and family were there. Implemented alone, a curfew is a band-aid that makes isolation worse. A lasting solution must address root causes.\n\nTeens are seeking what we all need\n\n\nTeens are seeking stimulation because they’re bored. Out-of-school programs may be facing federal freezes and state shortfalls, but local parks, libraries, and nonprofits are a nexus for youth sports, clubs, arts, education and volunteering. But Indy’s parks are woefully underfunded — we pay less than half the national median. Our libraries once fared better, but recent cuts have decimated that lead. It’s no wonder Indiana ranks bottom ten for supporting children. We must invest more.\n\nTeens are seeking connection because they’re lonely. Teens were spending less time with friends even before COVID, but they’re also isolated from their families — 40% of children lack strong emotional bonds with their parents. One solution is having mentor-like adults outside home. But young people report fewer mentor figures than ever. Older people describe their teenage years as full of feedback from adults in their community. That community has fragmented, and youth mental health has deteriorated alongside it. We can all do more to engage youth in our neighborhoods.\n\nBriggs: Fountain Square camp shows Indianapolis' homelessness strategy is broken\n\nFinally, teens are seeking support. But we’ve designed a system that makes it almost impossible to care for our children. Indiana restricts teaching teens what could get them pregnant. New parents lack guaranteed paid parental leave. Many towns sit in tri-county childcare deserts — we rank worst in the country, costing billions. Parents must work to keep Medicaid, so kids go unsupervised. Child abuse reports often go uninvestigated, even as unhoused children sleep at DCS offices. And Indiana’s youth homelessness rate continues to balloon faster than the national rate. It’s all too easy to blame parents. Yet we’ve adopted policies that abandon them. Let’s flip that script and put families first.\n\nI know exactly what would have kept Dakari from going downtown — he needed something better to do. We all have a role in that responsibility. Let’s make Indianapolis a city that’s safe and enriching for our youth.\n\nRonak Shah is a middle school science teacher in Indianapolis.",
