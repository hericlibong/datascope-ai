    "content": "How HISD’s Sunrise Centers are helping underserved students\n\nHOUSTON – For many parents back to school can be a financial burden. Last school year the Houston Independent School District announced it was eliminating its wraparound services department, which helped families struggling to provide basic necessities to their children.\n\n“[I was] worried, as were other parents in my situation; how are they going to do it?” said Maria Reynoso, who has a son in high school in HISD. “Economically everything’s getting high, but our paycheck is still the same amount.”\n\n2 Investigates met Reynoso at HISD’s Sunrise Center set-up inside Mission Milby on Broadway in southeast Houston. She was picking up school supplies and clothes for her son.\n\nSEE ALSO: Kinder Institute uses research to help HISD improve Sunrise Centers\n\nReynoso said the cost of ensuring her son has what he needs for school means making tough choices.\n\n“I’m still trying to see if I’m not going to get evicted from my apartment,” said Reynoso.\n\n“So, the choice is get everything your teenager needs or pay rent?” asked 2 investigates Robert Arnold.\n\n“Yes, for me it’s get everything I need for school or pay rent?” said Reynoso.\n\nIn prior years, HISD’s wraparound services department would help struggling families connect with support services so their children could go to class and learn. Budget constraints and dwindling enrollment forced HISD to shutter this department.\n\nHowever, the district opened seven Sunrise Centers in the fall of 2023. HISD partnered with the Houston Education Research Consortium (HERC), which is part of Rice University’s Kinder Institute, to determine where the Centers should be located and what services should be offered.\n\n\nThe centers offer food, clothes, educational support, healthcare, mental health support, help with transportation and a variety of other services.\n\nRice’s data shows 80-percent of HISD students are economically disadvantaged. HISD opened an eighth center this month at Marian Community Center on South Gessner in southwest Houston.\n\n“We know that when kids aren’t well, or if they’re not being serviced with food or clothes, sometimes that adds to truancy, that they don’t go to school. So, this is a way to help that, support that, and then get the attendance up as well,” said HISD superintendent Mike Miles.\n\nHISD’s data shows in the first year of operation the Centers served 30,900 families, and Rice’s data shows those who went to a Center showed a 33-percent improvement in attendance or behavior.\n\nOne of the differences between the centers and the now shuttered wraparound services department is they are in the community and families can walk-in without an appointment.\n\n“It was hard to get an appointment at the school and up here you can just walk in, and then they can see you right there and then instead of trying to get an appointment,” said Reynoso.\n\nRice researchers point out it is easier to measure effectiveness at the Centers since student needs are in one place. Prior to the Centers, students and their families would go to a school and get a referral for support at different locations.\n\nThe Centers were set-up within existing community centers like Mission Milby, the YMCA or City of Houston facility. According to Rice, HISD is hoping to eventually expand to 12 Centers to reach all underserved communities identified by HERC.\n\n“They do ask what school do your kids go to? And they, the people, that’s their work for HISD, so they know how to help you and what you’re needing for that certain grade,” said Reynoso.\n\nHere are the locations of the HISD Sunrise Centers",

          "description": "The International Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) produces regular Assessment Reports that provide global warming potentials (GWPs) for greenhouse gases (GHG) in the context of multiple time horizons including 20, 100, and 500 years. The GWPs (in kg CO2-equivalent per kg GHG) can be multiplied by kg GHGs emitted for use in estimating CO2-equivalent (CO2e) impacts of GHGs emitted. In the context of life cycle assessment (LCA) , the GWPs can be used as characterization factors in of the life cycle impact assessment. This dataset provides 20- (GWP-20), 100- (GWP-100) and 500-year (GWP-500) GWPs from the 4th (AR4), 6th (AR6) IPCC assessment reports, and 20- (GWP-20) and 100-year (GWP-100) GWPs from the 5th (AR5) report (AR5 provided no 500 yr GWPs). Datasets are provided in simple tables in Excel, in the openLCA JSON-LD format compliant with the U.S. Federal LCA Commons standards, and in Apache parquet format for the most efficient import into applications or scripts using languages like Python and R. The names for GHGs are from the Federal LCA Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.2, which are names preferred for this GHGs in the USEPA's Substance Registry Service. These datasets were created using the LCIA Formatter v1.1.1 (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter).  The GWP values are provided in these formats for convenient use; the values have not been altered from the values reported in the Assessment Reports. \nPython code used to produce the data is available in a github gist under the supporting data links along with dataset metadata from the LCIA formatter.\n",

The GWPs (in kg CO2-equivalent per kg GHG) can be multiplied by kg GHGs emitted for use in estimating CO2-equivalent (CO2e) impacts of GHGs emitted. In the context of life cycle assessment (LCA) , the GWPs can be used as characterization factors in of the life cycle impact assessment. This dataset provides 20- (GWP-20), 100- (GWP-100) and 500-year (GWP-500) GWPs from the 4th (AR4), 6th (AR6) IPCC assessment reports, and 20- (GWP-20) and 100-year (GWP-100) GWPs from the 5th (AR5) report (AR5 provided no 500 yr GWPs). Datasets are provided in simple tables in Excel, in the openLCA JSON-LD format compliant with the U.S. Federal LCA Commons standards, and in Apache parquet format for the most efficient import into applications or scripts using languages like Python and R. The names for GHGs are from the Federal LCA Elementary Flow List (FEDEFL) v1.2, which are names preferred for this GHGs in the USEPA's Substance Registry Service. These datasets were created using the LCIA Formatter v1.1.1 (https://github.com/USEPA/LCIAformatter).  The GWP values are provided in these formats for convenient use; the values have not been altered from the values reported in the Assessment Reports. \nPython code used to produce the data is available in a github gist under the supporting data links along with dataset metadata from the LCIA formatter.\n",

The index values are generally lower than the Canadian average. The median value is 0.78, and 88% of the communities have a value of less than 1.00 which is the Canadian norm. The values tend to be higher in Western Canada, especially in the southern part of British Columbia, and also in the larger communities with a population of 5000 or greater.",
