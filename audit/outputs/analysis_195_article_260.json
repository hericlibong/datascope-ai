    "content": "‘Social apnoea’: sleep disorder could worsen at weekends, research suggests\n\nLifestyle factors such as drinking and smoking could contribute to increased severity of obstructive sleep apnoea\n\netting your hair down at the weekend might be a well-known recipe for a hangover, but researchers say it might also increase the severity of a common sleep disorder.\n\nObstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) involves complete pauses in breathing or partial reductions in airflow that arise because muscles in the back of the throat relax, causing the airways to narrow or close. It is more common in groups such as older people and people who are overweight or obese.\n\nNow researchers have found the severity of the condition increases at the weekend. The study cannot prove the cause, but suggests it could be down to lifestyle factors such an increase in drinking and smoking, or changes in the type or patterns of sleep – all of which can increase the risk of the condition. As a result, they have called the phenomenon “social apnoea”.\n\n“Obviously, people tend to drink more on the weekend. They tend to smoke more on the weekend if they are prone to smoking,” said Prof Danny Eckert, a co-author of the research at Flinders University in Australia, adding that as well as a possible effect from irregular sleep patterns, it might also be that people were less likely to use devices such as continuous positive airway pressure (Cpap) machines to manage the condition at the weekend.\n\nThe researchers say regardless of the underlying cause, the results matter given the health and safety implications of OSA. It is known to raise the risk of conditions including stroke, high blood pressure and type 2 diabetes, and can also affect driving safety as a result of sleepiness, have an impact on relationships, and reduce quality of life.\n\nWriting in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, Eckert and colleagues report how they analysed de-identified data from 70,052 people – the majority of whom were middle-aged, male, and overweight – who used a commercially available under-mattress sleep sensor that can track heart rate, snoring and sleep apnoea.\n\nAll participants had four or more sleep recordings a week, at least 28 sleep apnoea measurements a year, and five or more breathing disruptions an hour during sleep, on average, a year.\n\nThe team found the odds of moderate to severe sleep apnoea, meaning 15 or more breathing interruptions an hour, were 18% higher on Saturdays compared with Wednesdays, and the effect was more pronounced in men and people under the age of 60.\n\nThey also found weekend catch-up sleep of 45 minutes or more, compared with less than six minutes, and social jetlag – in other words, a clock-shift in sleep patterns – of 60 minutes or more, compared with less than 18 minutes, was associated with 47% and 38% greater odds of having moderate to severe OSA respectively.\n\nDr Sriram Iyer, an NHS respiratory and sleep consultant, who was not involved in the work, said the study highlighted the night-to-night variability in OSA symptoms, and the team’s assumptions about the cause of the weekend uptick were “perfectly reasonable”.\n\nRyan Chin Taw Cheong, a consultant ENT and sleep surgeon at the Cleveland clinic, London, praised the size of the study, saying it was the first of its kind to look at variability in the severity of the condition throughout the week.\n\nWhile he noted that study did not include data on participants’ lifestyles, meaning it could not prove the cause of the increased severity of OSA at the weekends, he said factors such as smoking and drinking were known to exacerbate symptoms, and addressing such issues – alongside diet and weight – should be one of the first steps taken to tackle the condition.\n\n“With the best intentions, we can try to treat you medically. But if you’re consuming lots of alcohol or smoking heavily, whatever we’re doing as medical professionals will be just a drop in the ocean,” Cheong said.",

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2021 or 2020 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2017–2021, or 2016–2020 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year.

Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the \"Primary Data Set\" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR. \n \nThe current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014, is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014. Nutrient profiles were added for 265 new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).  New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods such as several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample. </p><div><br>Resources in this dataset:</div><br><ul><li><p>Resource Title: USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Dataset for What We Eat In America, NHANES 2013-14 (Survey SR 2013-14).</p> <p>File Name: SurveySR_2013_14 (1).zip</p><p>Resource Description: Access database downloaded on November 16, 2017.

This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographic part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there are no data available, the data are too sparse, or there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.  \n\nNote that the reported sub-state trends are from Health Service Areas (HSA) and the data reported from the health care facilities located within the given HSA. Health Service Areas are regions of one or more counties that align to patterns of care seeking. The HSA level data are reported for each county in the HSA. \n\nMore information on HSAs is available <a href=\"https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/hsa.html\"><b>here</b></a>.\n\nFor the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on for sub-state (HSA) emergency department time series, trajectory classifications are based on approximations of the first derivative (slope) of trends that are smoothed using generalized additive models (GAMs). To determine time intervals in which the slope is sufficiently changing (i.e., rate of change distinguishable from 0), 95% confidence intervals for the slope approximations are calculated and assessed. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval not containing 0 are classified as increasing if the slope estimate is positive and decreasing if the slope estimate is negative. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval containing 0 are classified as stable. In the scenario that an HSA's time series is determined to be too sparse (i.e., many weeks with percentages of 0%), a model is not fit, and the HSA is classified as “sparse”.  \n\nFor additional information, please see: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html#companion-guide\"><b>Companion Guide: NSSP Emergency Department Data on Respiratory Illness</b></a>\n\nUpdated once per week on Fridays. ",

PLACES covers the entire United States—50 states and the District of Columbia—at county, place, census tract, and ZIP Code Tabulation Area levels. It provides information uniformly on this large scale for local areas at four geographic levels. Estimates were provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Division of Population Health, Epidemiology and Surveillance Branch. PLACES was funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in conjunction with the CDC Foundation. This dataset includes estimates for 36 measures: 13 for health outcomes, 9 for preventive services use, 4 for chronic disease-related health risk behaviors, 7 for disabilities, and 3 for health status. These estimates can be used to identify emerging health problems and to help develop and carry out effective, targeted public health prevention activities. Because the small area model cannot detect effects due to local interventions, users are cautioned against using these estimates for program or policy evaluations. Data sources used to generate these model-based estimates are Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) 2021 or 2020 data, Census Bureau 2021 or 2020 county population estimate data, and American Community Survey 2017–2021, or 2016–2020 estimates. The 2023 release uses 2021 BRFSS data for 29 measures and 2020 BRFSS data for 7 measures (all teeth lost, dental visits, mammograms, cervical cancer screening, colorectal cancer screening, core preventive services among older adults, and sleeping less than 7 hours) that the survey collects data on every other year. More information about the methodology can be found at  www.cdc.gov/places.",

      "description": "<p>The dataset, Survey-SR, provides the nutrient data for assessing dietary intakes from the national survey What We Eat In America, National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (WWEIA, NHANES). Historically, USDA databases have been used for national nutrition monitoring (1). Currently, the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies (FNDDS) (2), is used by Food Surveys Research Group, ARS, to process dietary intake data from WWEIA, NHANES. Nutrient values for FNDDS are based on Survey-SR. Survey-SR was referred to as the \"Primary Data Set\" in older publications. Early versions of the dataset were composed mainly of commodity-type items such as wheat flour, sugar, milk, etc. However, with increased consumption of commercial processed and restaurant foods and changes in how national nutrition monitoring data are used (1), many commercial processed and restaurant items have been added to Survey-SR. \n \nThe current version, Survey-SR 2013-2014, is mainly based on the USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference (SR) 28 (2) and contains sixty-six nutrientseach for 3,404 foods. These nutrient data will be used for assessing intake data from WWEIA, NHANES 2013-2014. Nutrient profiles were added for 265 new foods and updated for about 500 foods from the version used for the previous survey (WWEIA, NHANES 2011-12).  New foods added include mainly commercially processed foods such as several gluten-free products, milk substitutes, sauces and condiments such as sriracha, pesto and wasabi, Greek yogurt, breakfast cereals, low-sodium meat products, whole grain pastas and baked products, and several beverages including bottled tea and coffee, coconut water, malt beverages, hard cider, fruit-flavored drinks, fortified fruit juices and fruit and/or vegetable smoothies. Several school lunch pizzas and chicken products, fast-food sandwiches, and new beef cuts were also added, as they are now reported more frequently by survey respondents. Nutrient profiles were updated for several commonly consumed foods such as cheddar, mozzarella and American cheese, ground beef, butter, and catsup. The changes in nutrient values may be due to reformulations in products, changes in the market shares of brands, or more accurate data. Examples of more accurate data include analytical data, market share data, and data from a nationally representative sample. </p><div><br>Resources in this dataset:</div><br><ul><li><p>Resource Title: USDA National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Dataset for What We Eat In America, NHANES 2013-14 (Survey SR 2013-14).</p> <p>File Name: SurveySR_2013_14 (1).zip</p><p>Resource Description: Access database downloaded on November 16, 2017.

This dataset provides the percentage of emergency department patient visits for the specified pathogen of all ED patient visits for the specified geographic part of the country that were observed for the given week from data submitted to the National Syndromic Surveillance Program (NSSP). In addition, the trend over time is characterized as increasing, decreasing or no change, with exceptions for when there are no data available, the data are too sparse, or there are not enough data to compute a trend. These data are to provide awareness of how the weekly trend is changing for the given geographic region.  \n\nNote that the reported sub-state trends are from Health Service Areas (HSA) and the data reported from the health care facilities located within the given HSA. Health Service Areas are regions of one or more counties that align to patterns of care seeking. The HSA level data are reported for each county in the HSA. \n\nMore information on HSAs is available <a href=\"https://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/variables/countyattribs/hsa.html\"><b>here</b></a>.\n\nFor the emergency department time series, trajectory classifications reported on for sub-state (HSA) emergency department time series, trajectory classifications are based on approximations of the first derivative (slope) of trends that are smoothed using generalized additive models (GAMs). To determine time intervals in which the slope is sufficiently changing (i.e., rate of change distinguishable from 0), 95% confidence intervals for the slope approximations are calculated and assessed. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval not containing 0 are classified as increasing if the slope estimate is positive and decreasing if the slope estimate is negative. Weeks with a 95% confidence interval containing 0 are classified as stable. In the scenario that an HSA's time series is determined to be too sparse (i.e., many weeks with percentages of 0%), a model is not fit, and the HSA is classified as “sparse”.  \n\nFor additional information, please see: <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncird/surveillance/respiratory-illnesses/index.html#companion-guide\"><b>Companion Guide: NSSP Emergency Department Data on Respiratory Illness</b></a>\n\nUpdated once per week on Fridays. ",

      "description": "U.S. consumers demand variety, quality, and convenience in the foods they consume. As Americans have become wealthier and more ethnically diverse, the American food basket reflects a growing share of tropical products, spices, and imported gourmet products. Seasonal and climatic factors drive U.S. imports of popular types of fruits and vegetables and tropical products, such as cocoa and coffee. In addition, a growing share of U.S. imports can be attributed to intra-industry trade, whereby agricultural-processing industries based in the United States carry out certain processing steps offshore and import products at different levels of processing from their subsidiaries in foreign markets.\r\n \r\nThis data set provides import values of edible products (food and beverages) entering U.S. ports and their origin of shipment. Data are from the U.S. Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau. Food and beverage import values are compiled by calendar year into food groups corresponding to major commodities or level of processing. At least 10 years of annual data are included, enabling users to track long-term growth patterns.",

The California BRFSS is an annual cross-sectional health-related telephone survey that collects data about California residents regarding their health-related risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and use of preventive services. The BRFSS is conducted by Public Health Survey Research Program of California State University, Sacramento under contract from CDPH. This indicator is based on the question: \"“Has a doctor, nurse or other health professional EVER told you that you have a depressive disorder (including depression, major depression, dysthymia, or minor depression)?” NOTE: Denominator data and weighting was taken from the California Department of Finance, not U.S. Census. Values may therefore differ from what has been published in the national BRFSS data tables by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) or other federal agencies.",
