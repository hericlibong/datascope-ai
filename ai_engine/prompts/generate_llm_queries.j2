Description: {angle_desc}

TASK
Produce exactly six web search queries, in order:
1–3 = DATASET queries (open-data, data-ready)
4–6 = SOURCE queries (official reports / methodology / surveillance)

REQUIREMENTS FOR DATASET QUERIES
- Include the core angle terms (topic/species), the geography if present (“France”, “département”, “commune”, etc.), and the time window if relevant (e.g., 2010..2024).
- Include at least one data-access marker: csv OR json OR geojson OR api OR wfs OR wms OR "jeu de données" OR download OR geonetwork OR catalog.
- Add negative terms to reduce noise: -pdf -thèse -hal -researchgate -oapen -dumas.
- Use quotes for exact phrases when helpful.
- Use AT MOST ONE site: constraint among the three dataset queries (e.g., site:data.gouv.fr, site:opendatasoft.com, site:gbif.org, site:inpn.mnhn.fr, site:ecdc.europa.eu, site:data.gov, site:data.gov.uk).

REQUIREMENTS FOR SOURCE QUERIES
- Target methodology, official surveillance pages, and reports (e.g., Santé publique France, ministerial portals, WHO/ECDC).
- Use AT MOST ONE site: constraint among the three source queries.

OUTPUT RULES (STRICT)
- Return ONLY valid JSON; no prose, no comments.
- Top-level object must contain a single key named "queries" with EXACTLY six objects.
- Objects 1–3: "kind" = "dataset" and "intent" = "dataset".
- Objects 4–6: "kind" = "source" and "intent" = "source".
- Each object MUST have these fields and names EXACTLY: "text", "kind", "intent".
- NEVER use keys named "query" or "q".
- Begin with a left curly brace then the key "queries", and end with a right curly brace.
