You are helping a newsroom find links for one editorial angle.

ANGLE
Title: {angle_title}
Description: {angle_desc}

TASK
Return a single list of 4–6 items in total for this angle:
• 2–3 dataset-like links (first)
• 2–3 source/documentation links (after)

DEFINITIONS
Dataset-like = data access pages (dataset/datasets, data, datastore, statistics, api, download) OR a catalogue search page with the query kept in the URL (e.g., ?q=...). Never a homepage or near-root page.
Source/Documentation = methodology notes, glossaries, surveillance/bulletins, official thematic pages, reports that explain or contextualize data (not direct file downloads).

HOW TO BUILD LINKS
• Use the angle’s cues in the description (Q, Metrics, Granularity, Data) to craft precise queries in the same language as the angle.
• If you cannot provide a specific dataset landing page, return an official catalogue search URL with the query preserved (not a bare homepage). Prefer pages that keep ?q=… or an equivalent query parameter.
• If a portal drops the query and redirects to a root page, choose another result that preserves the query or a concrete dataset page on the topic.

QUALITY RULES
• Do not return homepages or near-root pages.
• Prefer pages with CSV/JSON/API or explicit “Download/API” entries for datasets.
• Prefer recent/maintained pages when possible.
• Avoid duplicates or near-duplicates (same landing page).
• Ensure datasets include at least one item matching the granularity hinted by the angle (e.g., department/commune or monthly period).
• Ensure sources include at least one methodology/surveillance page when relevant.

OUTPUT
Return exactly the JSON that matches:

(Do not add extra fields. Use concise newsroom titles. Keep any search query parameters in the URL.)
