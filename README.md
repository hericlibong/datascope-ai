## âœ¨ Project Overview

This repository serves as the foundation for a new architecture that goes beyond experimentation to become a robust tool tailored for real newsroom needs.

The project will include:
- A structured backend for handling document analysis, user sessions, and feedback.
- An orchestrated AI engine to guide article analysis, editorial suggestions, and data source recommendations.
- A user-friendly front-end to deliver a smooth and accessible experience to non-technical users.
- Full internationalization support (FR/EN) from the start.

The overall objective is to help journalists:
- Detect "data potential" in any article.
- Receive editorial angle suggestions.
- Get relevant open data sources to explore.
- Export structured insights easily for reuse.
